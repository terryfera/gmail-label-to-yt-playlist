# Make a youtube playlist from a gmail label

## Getting Started

This script will login to gmail and read all emails with a specified label. It will then use regex to find a youtube video ID in the body and then use that ID to 
post the video to a playlist.

Used to grab all the unlisted patreon video links in my email for KF games.
